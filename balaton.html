  <p class="textbody">In this section you can explore the wines by wine regions in Hungary. Admittedly these are not all of the regions, also it is more of a subjective selection. Just as you would recommend bottles of wine to your friends.<br>
    Wine making and drinking has a big tradition in Hungary. It is something that connects the lowest and the highest classes of society just as much nowadays, as it did hundreds of years ago. Drinking wine in Hungary has its own atmosphere. It connects people. Hopefully, you will get a sense of that.</p>
  <p class="textbody">It is worth mentioning that in the summer 'fröccs' is a popular alcoholic drink. It is white wine or rose mixed with sparkling water. It is just as popular as drinking beer. Fröccs has many variations based on the proportion of the wine and the water in the mix. These all have different names. Don't get weirded out if you see someone drinking it, try it yourself!<br>
    Here's  a little story about the origin of fröccs: in 1842 András Fáy (writer and politician) was hosting a harvest home, alongside many, he invited Mihály Vörösmarty (famous Hungarian poet) and Ányos Jedlik (inventor of the dynamo and the electric motor). Ányos Jedlik brought with him the first prototype of  a sparkling water siphon, he demonstrated the use of it and mixed the water with wine, so it would lose from it's strength and the guests wouldn't get drunk so fast in the heat. So he created the first fröccs, but called it spriccer, which obviously comes from German. The poet Vörösmarty didn't like the name and he named it 
  fröccs. Later on he mentioned the drink in his poem, 'A song from Fót'.</p>

BALATON-FELVIDÉK
</p>
<p class="textheader2">
Badacsonyi Szürkebarát 2011, Szeremley winery
</p>
<p class="textbody">
A classic, traditional Pinot Gris of Badacsony with lively, crispy acids. Lovely vanilla notes due to ageing in a wooden barrel blend with a floral bouquet and ripe apple notes. The salty, mineral notes typical for the region prevail on the palate.
</p>
<p class="textheader2">
Badacsonyi Kéknyelű 2007, Szeremley winery
</p>
<p class="textbody">
The oldest and noblest grape variety in Badacsony, unique and exclusive not only in Hungary but in the whole world. It is dioecious, which means it bears less fruits, but gives more concentrated wine. Despite it’s mildness it has a surprisingly long aftertaste. It’s young, fresh and rich in minerals, which makes it an ideal pairing with trout, sole and noble fishes, lobster and goat cheese. Great choice for special occasions. 
</p>
<p class="textheader2">
Dörgicsei Rozé 2013, Pántlika winery
</p>
<p class="textbody">
A rose wine with bright pink colour. Its bouquet is dominated by strawberry and raspberry. Its lively, refreshing acids are in perfect harmony. Its fine fragrances of red berries are quite expressive, while the aftertaste offers long-lasting and concentrated aromas. 
</p>
<p class="textheader2">
Cabernet Sauvignon 2012, Istvándy winery
</p>
<p class="textbody">
In this dry red we can notice cocoa, coffee, dried sour cherry and blueberry accompanied by a mild aroma of herbs. The intense taste shows gentle, stroking tennis and delicate use of wood. The taste and smell show all the characteristics of this terroir. 
</p>
<p class="textheader2">
III 2011, Figula winery
</p>
<p class="textbody">
A three-variety blend from Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot -  the classical Bordeaux ingredients of this light red wine from the northern shores of Lake Balaton. Colour of ruby and flavours of cherries, plums and red currants. Always a delight to taste it.
